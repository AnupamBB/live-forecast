### Problem Statement

Weather forecasting is a complicated process that involves a whole lot of data, mathematical models, and computation. A lot of data from different sources, like satellites, are accumulated and analyzed. Powerful computers use this data to make predictions.The process entails three steps: observation, analysis and communication.There needs to be a platform where any one can enter the place name and know the weather details at that moment.

### How we plan to solve the problem

I present to you Live Forecast.It is a very simple and user friendly application which we made by using OpenWeather api so it's supper accurate.For now I am just displaying the places temparature from the api but we can also give the other weather details to users.
